<p>On the afternoon of Jan. 16, 2015, Nuruzzaman Jony called his 7-month-pregnant wife from an unknown phone number. He was in hiding, alarmed by a surge in arrests of fellow activists of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). </p>

<p>“We’ll go to the doctor together later today,” he promised, as he tried to compensate for two nights of absence at her side. “But let me go see Hira first.”</p>

<p>Moniruzzaman Hira, his younger brother who had just returned home from a 40-day religious retreat, was picked up and framed in a theft case by the police. A top activist of the BNP’s student wing in a key neighborhood in Dhaka, Jony knew that detaining his apolitical brother was just a way of punishing him for his activism. </p>

<p>Heightened police activities around that time stemmed from a fresh round of protests by the BNP on the first anniversary of the 2014 elections that most opposition parties had boycotted. Hira was in prison awaiting trial — no longer in police custody — thus safe to meet.</p>

<p>By late afternoon, Jony called his wife, Munia Parveen, to say he had checked in on Hira and was about to join her so they both could see the doctor. That would be the last time Parveen heard from him. </p>

<p>It would only be after the next morning that she realized Jony had been killed during an alleged late-night gunfight between police detectives and her husband’s associates at the heart of the capital city. Before he was killed, according to a presser by police, Jonny had admitted to causing an explosion targeting a police outpost two days earlier, a charge his family maintains was made-up.</p>

<p>At the morgue in Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Parveen was able to count the number of gunshot wounds Jony’s body sustained: 18, in total, with all but two in the chest. “That was a cold-blooded murder,” she said in a recent interview.</p>

<p>Jony’s killing was one among more than 2,500 killings carried out by security forces in Bangladesh between 2009 and 2021, according to a Netra News analysis of data gathered by a rights group over a period of 13 years. A vast majority of the killings, according to family members, press reports, and rights groups, appear deliberate and targeted — often meted out after security forces had the victims under their custody, the analysis shows. The analysis also revealed clear upward trends of such killings during, before, and after the national elections, held in 2014 and 2018, which were widely attributed as unfair and fraudulent, and unearthed widespread targeting of Rohingya refugees.</p>

<p>Since coming to power in 2009, the Bangladesh government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has increasingly grown authoritarian: Bertelsmann Stiftung’s widely followed index puts Bangladesh as a “moderate autocracy.” Global and domestic rights groups have long alleged that her government oversaw hundreds of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearance, especially targeting her political opponents. </p>

<p>The dataset compiled by the Asian Human Rights Commission, a Hong Kong-based regional rights organization, and Odhikar, a domestic rights group, and prepared by Netra News comprises incidents of shootouts and other gunshot wounds caused by security forces, as reported by local news sources, which were mostly based on the press releases issued by the forces, and other deaths resulted from alleged custodial torture.</p>

<p>In addition to its analysis of the data, Netra News has decided to publish a refined and shortened version of the dataset in full, as Bangladesh authorities routinely seek to discredit rights groups’ figures on extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearance. </p>

<h2>Perpetrators</h2>

<p>As many as 1,674 casualties were recorded to have taken place in unique incidents. The remaining 919 lethal casualties occurred in 358 multiple-casualty incidents, each of which witnessed more than one killing.</p>

<p>Based on the descriptions of the killings published in the press, Netra News categorized the killings into premeditated or targeted killings of individuals in custody, deaths resulted from indiscriminate or justified law enforcement response to protests or violence, deaths resulted from alleged torture of individuals known to be in custody and other accidental deaths. </p>

<p>More than 80%, or 2,095, of the total number of 2593 killings documented in the dataset bear some hallmarks of targeted murders i.e., carried out after the subjects were already in the custody of the respective security forces. Of the total number, 195 are allegedly torture-related casualties.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite police unit controlled by deputized military officers, has come under close scrutiny for carrying out alleged extrajudicial executions. Since its founding as a crime-busting agency in 2004, extrajudicial killings in Bangladesh have almost been synonymous with the RAB, as the agency engaged in deliberate lethal actions to eliminate its targets in the guise of “gunfights” or “crossfire.” In 2021, the United States government imposed unprecedented economic and diplomatic sanctions against the RAB and its current and former leadership. </p>

<p>However, the analysis by Netra News reveals that non-RAB units within Bangladesh Police were collectively responsible for most extrajudicial executions between 2009, when the Awami League returned to power, and 2021, the latest year to be fully documented. </p>

<p>Regular police forces singlehandedly carried out more than half, or 59%, of the 2594 killings recorded in this period. In addition, policemen participated in joint operations with other forces, including RAB and the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), resulting in the deaths of an additional 142 people.</p>

<p>Of the 2,095 killings that appear to be targeted extrajudicial executions, regular police units were singlehandedly responsible for 1,191 or 56%, and dozens of others in collaboration with other agencies or RAB.</p>

<p>However, the regular police have a number of units. Although Bangladesh’s centralized state means the police force scattered across the country is under the central headquarters in the capital city, several units within the force often act with some level of autonomy and influence. One example of that is the Detective Branch (DB), whose members in Dhaka killed Jony. (The analysis could not attribute all incidents to specific units within the police because of insufficient background information.)</p>

<p>One major exception is RAB, which is technically under the police but enjoys operational freedom and is essentially outside the effective purview of the police headquarters. The RAB comprises members of the military forces, who dominate it, and other security and law enforcement agencies. The RAB’s nominal head is a senior police official, but the commanders of its operational sub-units are mid-ranking military officers. And when considered as a unit of a greater force, no other unit surpassed the RAB in terms of killing: the unit alone carried out more than 7,00 incidents that bear the signs of extrajudicial executions. In addition, the elite unit led or participated in joint operations with other units or forces that killed about 75 people.</p>

<p>Another major contributor to the phenomenon is the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), which has been responsible for maintaining the country’s border. But in recent years, the agency — led exclusively by officers deputized from the military — has increasingly used lethal means to eliminate seemingly premeditated targets. Members of the border forces killed 141 people in solo operations, 101 of whom appear to have been targeted beforehand, besides partaking in joint operations that caused more than 70 other lethal casualties.</p>


<h2>Hikes in election seasons</h2>

<p>Since 2009, Bangladesh has seen two elections, respectively, in 2014 and 2018. Both elections were married by controversies. Opposition parties boycotted elections in 2014, leading the ruling party to win largely uncontested. The 2018 election, while participated by the opposition, saw widespread fraud: the ruling party won more than 96% of the parliamentary seats in a North Korea-esque brazen rigging.</p>

<p>During and in the aftermath of both elections, targeted and indiscriminate killings saw a sharp rise, the analysis shows. </p>

<p>In 2013, when the opposition began its protests over elections, security forces killed 270 people, four times the number of those killed in the previous year. Both in the election year in 2014 and in the immediate post-election year, in 2015, when the BNP and its allies attempted to revive election protests, Bangladesh saw a high-level of lethal casualties by security forces: 172 and 186, respectively. </p>

<p>The trend continued until 2017: From 2013 to 2017, security agencies killed 192 people a year on average. However, the executions again saw a sharp increase in 2018, also an election year, when the government launched the so-called war against drug. The year was deadliest recorded: as many as 465 people were killed by security agencies, an increase of 242% compared to the previous 5-year average. The trend slowed down in the following two years, which were still marked by high number of casualties: 391 and 223 respectively.</p>

<p>What’s also extraordinary about the 2018 period is that the fewer number of protest-related non-targeted killings. In 2013, only 73 of the 270 people or about 27% of those killed in the hands of security forces appear targeted or premeditaded. (The figures do not include those allegedly killed during the May 5th rally by Hefazat-e-Islam due to ambigiguties surrounding the number and identities of the victims. Had they been included, the share of the targeted killings would be even less.)</p>

<p>In contrast, 457 of 465 people or more than 98% of those killed by security forces in 2018 appear targeted, meaning the victims had been apprehended before they were killed. A similar trend can be observed in 2019 and 2020, too.</p>


<h2>Location-wise and ethnographic trend </h2>

<p>An year-by-year analysis of the locations where the killings took place also revealed startling findings. The location data was refined to use only sub-district level variables.</p>

<p>Until 2018, the killings appeared scattered around the entire country, barring some regional trends. In the early years of the Awami League government, some localities in the western and southwestern Bangladesh, covering Khulna division, saw the killings of those allegedly associated with armed leftist groups. </p>

<p>In the eastern Bangladesh, the Chittagong Hill Tracts also witnessed the extrajudicial killings of indigenous men, allegedly tied with regional political and armed organizations. Many of those killings implicate the army, which has had a longstanding presence in the area. </p>

<p>However, in 2019, when the government announced its anti-drug campaign, everything changed in the southernmost sub-district of Tekanf in Cox’s Bazar. 113 of the 391 people killed in that year lived in the tiny sub-district, widely known as a drug entry point from neighboring Myanmar, whereas prior to 2019, the sub-district recorded fewer than 30 police-related deaths from 2013. Other sub-districts in Cox’s Bazar such as Chokoria and Maheshkhali were also disproportionate affected during that period.</p>

<p>Among those killed in 2019 are also 59 Rohingya refugees who lived in squalid refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. In 2020 and 2021, 56 other Rohingya refugees were killed, too. Prior to 2019, not a single Rohingya refugee was killed by security forces in Bangladesh.</p>

<h2>Methodologies and assumptions</h2>

<p>The AHRC and Odhikar compiled the data in multiple spreadsheets over the years. Except for a few cases, the data cited newspaper sources, which Netra News researchers corroborated and updated. Based on respective press reports, researchers also updated other key details respective to the cases.</p>

<p>Information in the “connotation” and “identity” columns may not be factually accurate. Connotations are based on what security forces said post-facto about the victims. They are meant to give the readers a sense of what justifications the security forces use in carrying out the executions.</p>

<p>As Bangladesh does not have maintain ZIP codes, Netra News re-formatted village or union-level locations data into sub-districts or districts. </p>

<p>Netra News did not — and could possibly not — independently investigate each and every case individually. However, many of the cases mentioned in the dataset are well known to be extrajudicial executions and they bear the traits of one.</p>

<p>In the case of conflicting statements, the analysis gave the statements from family members precedence. </p>

<p>Although Bangladesh authorities have consistently denied that its security forces routinely carry out extrajudicial killings, its claims often fly in the face of reality, let alone meriting serious considerations. </p>

<p>In early April, in response to a request for comment by Netra News and the German public broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Home Affairs, which oversees law enforcement forces, said, “[o]n receipt of any such allegation the Ministry duly investigate[s] each incident by an independent Magistrate. According to the investigation reports, the allegation made appears not to be authentic.”</p>

<p>However, the magistrates are neither “independent” nor do they “investigate” the killings. According to multiple rights investigators, the magistrates are junior executive bureaucrats or public servants under the strict control of the government, and they often sanction the killings before they even take place.</p>

<p>Even the pieces of papers the magistrates sign are kept strictly confidential and intended to be used only if legal implications arise in the future, multiple sources told Netra News.</p>

<p>In Jony’s case, his wife says, she was unable to obtain routine documentary evidence related to the killing for years, including the medical postmortem report and the case documents related to the death of her husband. </p>

<p>In February this year, Jony’s father decided to file a complaint in a local court implicating a number of police detectives in the killing, but the court immediately dismissed it. </p>

<p>Last year, the government cancelled the registrations of Odhikar, one of the rights organizations that helped build the dataset used in this story.</p>
