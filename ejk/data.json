According to Major Mohammad Sakhawat Hossain, then deputy director of the Legal and Media wing at RAB headquarters, RAB-1 had received specific information that a wanted criminal called Kamrul Islam Bappi was plotting a major crime at the spot. He claimed that criminals opened fire when the RAB team entered the building and the team fired back in self-defense. After the shooting ended, RAB discovered a body, which they identified as Kamrul Islam. The deceased’s family disputed the RAB claim, saying the victim’s name was Kaiser Mahmud, and not Kamrul Islam. Kaiser, 24, also had the common nickname of \"Bappi\". An autopsy conducted on September 11, 2009 identified the deceased as Kamruzzaman Bappi instead of Kaiser Mahmud or even Kamrul Islam. Later, a probe committee formed by the Home Ministry found that Bappi did not die in crossfire, as reported to the media by RAB. The probe report refuted most of the other claims made by RAB. It concluded that it was evident that Kaiser Mahmud was wrongfully killed by RAB due to a mistake.",

They saw two people in the van and asked them to stop as they were trying to drive away. At that time the two men opened fire at the RAB team, and a gunfight followed. The pick up managed to flee after a while. Later, RAB members found Zahidul's bullet-riddled body. He was rushed to Chittagong Medical College Hospital only to be declared dead on arrival.

The dead, Bachchu Mia, was a CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver who had been traceless since being \"detained by plainclothes officials\" on February 17, according to his family members. The family has been making this allegation since the day after his \"detention\". Bachchu was one of the accused in the case filed with Bahubal Police Station in connection with the killing of the four schoolboys. Kazi Moniruzzaman, Company Commander of RAB-9, claimed that they had detained Shaheed, one of the accomplices of Bacchu. A team of the elite force conducted a drive in Dawargachh area to arrest Bacchu as Shaheed informed them that he was preparing to flee to India. Sensing the presence of RAB members, Bachchu along with his accomplices \"opened fire on them\". The RAB team fired back, triggering the \"gunfight\", the official said. Later, the bullet-hit body of Bachchu was found and sent to Chunarughat Upazila Health Complex for autopsy. But the family members turned down the Rab version. \"My husband never touched a gun, let alone operate it. How come he engaged in gunfight?\" said Bachchu's wife Rina Akther in a tearful voice. She alleged that two men in plainclothes on the afternoon of February 17 came to their house at Sundrateki village of the district looking for her husband. \"After talking to them outside the house, my husband came back and told me that police asked him to meet them for some reasons. He did not tell me the reasons and went away, \" After a while, she called her husband on his mobile phone, but he was not picking it up. At one stage, she found the phone switched off, Rina said. Contacted repeatedly, police could not provide any information on him, she added. Bachchu's mother Elai Bibi alleged that it was the RAB that picked up her son and killed him. \"My son was not involved in the killings. Even if he had been involved in the murders, court was there to try him. Why did he have to die without trial?\" she said.",

Abdur Rahman, an uncle of Jahangir Alam, said that on November 18, 2016 at around 1:30 am, some policemen came to their house with three vans and picked up Jahangir and Abid. Later, Jahangir’s family searched for them but no trace was found. The next day, Abdur Rahman phoned one of his relatives who works at the Jessore General Hospital and found that police had left Jahangir’s body in the hospital at around 3:00 am.

          "description": "Abdul Kalam, an alleged robber was killed in a \"gunfight\" with Rapid Action Battalion in Pologround area of Chittagong city on July 19, 2017. A team of Rab-7 raided Pologround area around 3:00am, acting on a tip-off that some arms dealers were trading firearms there, said Mimtanur Rahman, Assistant Director of RAB-7. He said when the RAB team reached the spot, the criminals opened fire. The RAB members then returned fire, triggering the \"gunfight\". After the gun battle, the RAB team found a bullet-hit man and took him to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Victim's family, however, said Kalam went outside his rented house in Baizid area on July 18 morning, saying he was going to work. But he did not return home at night. Md Ripon, the elder brother of Kalam's wife, said, \"In the morning, we came to know about his [Kalam] death from TV news. Family members of Kalam asked me to see whether Kalam was alright. I came to the hospital and identified his body. \" \"My sister's husband [Kalam] used to catch fish and look after their cattle in his village in Feni. He came here [Chittagong city] around six months ago. He used to work as a daily labourer. On July 18 morning, he told my sister that he was going to work in a vehicle as a helper, \" Ripon said. But the claim of exchanging fire between Kalam and RAB was not true as he had no firearm, he added.",

Around 3:30am, a group of six armed robbers waylaid a Laksham-bound pickup in Boro Kumira area on Dhaka-Chittagong highway, said Lt Col Miftah Uddin Ahmad, Commanding Officer of RAB-7. The vehicle, coming from Hathazari upazila, was carrying 21 people, including children and women, and wedding gifts for a bridegroom. The criminals beat up the people and looted valuables, including gold ornaments, and cash from them. The victims informed a RAB patrol team of the matter. After a short search, the RAB personnel found the robbers under a bridge where they were distributing the looted valuables among themselves. Sensing the presence of RAB, the robbers opened fire, forcing the RAB men to retaliate. After the \"gun battle\", the RAB team found a bullet-hit man on the spot and the looted valuables. The others managed to flee. He was declared dead after being taken to Sitakunda Upazila Health Complex.",

Rajon’s wife Surama Akhter, who along with her father-in-law came to DMCH around noon, said that her husband was picked up by a group of plain-clothed men on May 29 evening and he remained missing since then. She said that they later went to different law enforcement agencies, who denied her husband’s detention. ‘My husband was a human hauler driver and often used to take hemp but was not a drug peddler. He was accused in five cases but he was free on bail in all the cases, ’ she claimed. She said that they came to DMCH seeing television news of the death of one man namely Rajon in ‘gunfight’ at Basila.",

Teknaf Police Station Officer-in-charge Pradip Kumar Das said they arrested him from the Marine Drive in the tourist town around 10:00pm on 30 May. Saiful was picked up by law enforcers from Dhaka airport on May 25 on his arrival from Myanmar. He had fled there after the government declared a war on drug in May last year. Pradip said that during interrogation Saiful revealed a big consignment of yaba was being smuggled into Bangladesh from Myanmar through the Naf river. Police then took Saiful along to raid the area around 4:00am to seize the pills. \"Sensing police presence, the yaba kingpin’s associates opened fire, prompting police to fire back, triggering a gunfight, \" said Pradip. Caught in the line of fire, Saiful as well as four policemen were injured, and were taken to Teknaf Upazila Health Complex, said the OC. Saiful was later shifted to Cox’s Bazar Sadar Hospital where doctors declared him dead.",

However, Faruk Miya, older brother of Sher Khan, alleged that a six member police team, including Sub-Inspector Iftekhar, Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Monjur, ASI Rubel, Constable Delwar, and Constable Manik, arrested his brother. Police beat him mercilessly when he tried to escape from the motorbike. When the familymembers visited the police station 22 September night, they found Sher Khan lying on the floor in lock up. The on-duty constable said a sedative injection was given to him as he was feeling unwell. When Sher Khan did not regain consciousness next morning, his family members started crying at the police station and only then did he receive medical attention, added Faruk Mia. Faruk Mia further said that Sher Khan was a fish trader and there is no case against him. Faruk Miya claimed that his brother died because he was beaten by the police.",

The clash took place when a team of River Police was conducting a regular drive against jatka netting. Mohammad Kamruzzaman, a member of Chandpur River Police, said while patrolling in the Meghna river they chased a group of fishermen, who were catching jatka. Being chased by the law enforcers, the fishermen threw brick chips on them, prompting the police team to fire shotguns in self-defence, adding that Masud was hit by a bullet in his left thigh. After the clash, police detained bullet-hit Masud and two other fishermen from the spot. Later, Masud was taken to Matlab North Upazila Health Complex, from where he was shifted to DMCH as his condition deteriorated.",
